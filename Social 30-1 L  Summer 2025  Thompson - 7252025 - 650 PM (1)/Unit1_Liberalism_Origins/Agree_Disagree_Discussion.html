<p>"Our land is more valuable than your money. It will last forever. It will not even perish by the flames of fire. As long as the sun shines and the waters flow, this land will be here to give life to men and animals. We cannot sell the lives of men and animals. It was put here by the Great Spirit and we cannot sell it because it does not belong to us<b>"&nbsp;</b><strong><i>- Isapo-Muxika (Chief Crowfoot)</i></strong></p>

<p>'There is an uneven flow of economic resources. A small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system.'&nbsp;<i>- Martin Luther King, Jr.</i></p>
