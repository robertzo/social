<h1>Exploring Identity</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is identity? While this may seem like a simple question, the whole notion of identity can be quite complex and it has been the subject of considerable study by psychologists, philosophers, and social scientists. Identity encompasses not only an understanding of oneself but also a perception of one’s place in the world. How someone sees themselves is inextricably related to how they see their role in society.</p>
<p>In this lesson, you will be looking to answer the question: <strong>What is Identity?</strong></p>
<h2>Exploring Identity</h2>
<p class="CentreAlign"><img class="Rounded" src="images/hitlerpainting.png" alt="" width="422" height="306"></p>
<p>While you may not recognize the painting here, you have most likely heard of the painter. As a teenager, Adolf Hitler dreamed not of dominating the continent of Europe, but of becoming a great artist. When he was unable to pass the entrance exam for the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, Hitler’s interest eventually turned to politics.</p>
<p>How might the experience of being rejected by the art school have altered Hitler’s view of himself?</p>
<p>How might the world have been different if Hitler had continued to see himself primarily as an artist?</p>
<h2>Understandings of Identity</h2>
<p>Social scientists and philosophers have described identity as a sense of personal continuity - being the same identifiable individual over the course of time - and an understanding of oneself as unique from others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two main types of identity are <strong>personal </strong>(yourself is unique from others) and <strong>collective </strong>(what you share with others, such as language, culture, faith, and ethnicity).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Values</strong>&nbsp;are the principles, ideals, or moral standards of a person or a social group that supports or leads to a person's beliefs. A&nbsp;<strong>belief</strong>&nbsp;is often expressed as a firm opinion or conviction.</p>
<p>Discovering your own beliefs and values is a journey. People often talk and write about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are humans like, and why do they act the way they do?</li>
<li>What is the nature of society?</li>
<li>What is our role as individuals in society?</li>
</ul>
<p>In trying to answer these three questions, people create ideologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have particular ideas about who you are, where you are going, and what you would like the world around you to be like? Some of your ideas may be uniquely yours, and some of your ideas may be shared with others. Those ideas about the world that you share with other people may be part of an ideology.</p>
<p>For example, a holistic Indigenous perspective might stress the importance of community and environment in the formation of identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An <strong>ideology</strong> is a system of thought based on beliefs and values. An ideology includes ideas about how the world works, how we should live together, how we should treat one another, why we should or should not care about other people and society, and what society could become in the future. Once we consciously embrace an ideology, it may cause us to re-examine and reinterpret our own life according to the principles of the ideology.&nbsp;</p>
