<h1>Quiz - Illiberalism and Our Role</h1>
</div>
<!-- CONTENT -->
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This unit explored the reasons that a country may try to impose liberal ideologies on other countries and people. While bringing liberalism to the world is often done so with the best of intentions; as a means of bringing protection, humanitarianism, equality, and stability, it is not a task to be completed overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have learned that a number of different documents have been created to promote individual and collective rights. These legal documents often serve to protect the rights and freedoms of their citizens.</p>
<p>The unit also examined how liberal governments can take actions that threaten democracy or the rights and freedoms of their citizens. These illiberal actions can impact the very nature of liberal society itself.</p>
