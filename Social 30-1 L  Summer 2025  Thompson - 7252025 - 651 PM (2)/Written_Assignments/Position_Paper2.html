<h1>Writing Assignment - Position Paper (Full Version)</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will write a COMPLETE POSITION PAPER; the second of two writing tasks we need for this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignment II requires students to demonstrate the skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis in response to a written source.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Students will be presented with a written source that they must analyze to demonstrate an understanding of the perspective(s)&nbsp;<strong>reflected in the source.</strong></li>
<li>The position paper requires students to argue a position taken in response to a question regarding the <strong>perspective(s) reflected in the source</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is NOT a research paper or an opinion paper on the good or bad of Liberalism. <strong>It is about the Perspective on Liberalism in the Source. </strong>A position paper asks us to take a position on a topic, issue, source, or perspective, and back it up with arguments and evidence. Arguments and Evidence are often confused as the same things.&nbsp; Arguments are the why we should believe you, and evidence is the example of the why.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Analyze the following source and complete the assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="Example">
